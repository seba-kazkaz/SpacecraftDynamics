If you're trying to understand this problem and then implement the solution, I suggest you go about reading the files in this order:

1 - understand the context of this project, a sample solution approach and results from the presentation pdf
2 - understand the specific problem statement (equations etc) from the research paper pdf in the previous repository
3 - use the project code to guide you through the implementation of these equations

warning: The code I've written might be a pain to go through, it is disorganized and  rushed, full of mistakes. Pls proceed with patience while reading it, my apologies. so maybe? I'll go back and perfect this in the future. 

good luck.
